              I'm a computer science graduated student at Faculdade de CiÃªncias Aplicadas
              e Sociais de Petrolina in Brazil. I started my developer carreer as an intern
              in Java Web Development, using technologies like Java Server Faces, Primefaces,
              JPA and Hibernate. After the internship I dedicated my time on learning AngularJS 
              and then Angular to built componentized web apps. My first job as a developer was
              to work on development of web applications using AngularJS in a project and also 
              Angular on other recent projects in the front-end. As backend technologies we used 
              Flask on the older projects and migrated to Django on the recent projects to built REST API's.
              Now, working as a Full Stack Developer at Arctouch I'm focusing on learning React.js and Node.js
              that are our mainly used technologies. As a consequence I discovered Gatsby which is based on react
              and as a personal project to fix my knowlodge I built this page using a Gatsby template.
